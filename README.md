# Nice to meet you 😃

My name is [Ralph Ayala Jr](https://ralph-dev.netlify.app/), and I am a software engineer based in New York City.

I graduated from New York City College of Technology with a Bachelor’s degree in Software Development.

I chose programming because I enjoy building new things and the sense of accomplishment that comes from solving difficult problems.

My main languages are HTML and CSS, and I am currently strengthening my back-end knowledge. The tools I use include VS Code, Postman, and Node.js.

My favorite note-taking application is Notion. I love how simple and easy it is to organize my notes, especially for GitHub-related work.

My goals for this year:

- [ ] Find a full-time job in software engineering

- [ ] Consistently post projects here on GitHub, whether big or small
