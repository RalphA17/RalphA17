# Nice to meet you 😃

My name is [Ralph Ayala Jr](https://ralph-dev.netlify.app/), and I am a software engineer in New York City. 

I graduated New York City College of Technology with a Bachlor's Degree in Software Development. 

I chose programming because I enjoy the aspect of building new things and the satisfaction of accomplishing a difficult task.  

My main languages are **HTML**, and **CSS**. I am currently strengthing my back-end knownledge. The tools I use are **VS Code**, **Postman**, and **Node.js**. 

My favorite note taking application is Notion. Love how easy it is and simple I can orgainze my notes especally on GitHub. 

My goals for this year: 

- [ ] Find a full time job in software engineering. 
- [ ] Post projects here on GitHub. Regardless if these projects are big or small.
